### Hi there! :wave: :wink:
I'm Luã Braga from Brazil. I've been working as Web Developer since 2011 and currently I'm Tech Lead at [Grupo Líder](http://www.grupolideronline.com.br/).

I started to developer web applications using PHP, MySQL, JS, CSS and HTML. But here you will find a lot of studies and open sources projects I've been doing using Node JS as Back-End and React as Front-End.
